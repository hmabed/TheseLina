\begin{abstract}
The nano terahertz networks represent one of the promising areas in the field of wireless telecommunications. Technological advances in miniaturization of antennas and terahertz communications have paved the way for new network applications such as the body network, the programmable material and muti-core processors. Some of these applications require the concentration of a very large number of tiny nodes in a limited space. In this ultra-dense context and in the absence of access control units, we propose to define a distributed strategy of spatial and temporal traffic regulation to guard against the risks of congestion, interference and energy over-consumption. In this paper, we propose a protocol for optimizing radio links that both reduces the flow of redundant traffic over the network, smooths the volume of communications exchanged over time, and preserves the lifetime of the nodes.

\section{Introduction}

New network applications have emerged in recent years driven by major advances in the miniaturization of electronic devices and radio antennas. In ultra dense nanonetworks, a very large number of radio equipments are confined in a small space. In this context, the Terahertz frequency band has the double advantage of combining a high bandwidth with a low energy and spatial range. In the field of programmable material, for example, a large number of micro-robots are able to reorganize into different forms. Distributed reorganization algorithms can be greatly enhanced by the use of unrestricted communication procedures at neighboring nodes. The use of short-range terahertz communications also finds application in the field of massively multi-core computer architectures. The idea is to deploy a large number of processors on the same chip and replace the conventional communication buses with very high speed radio links \ cite {abadal}. 

Due to the limited computation and energy capabilities of the nanonetwork nodes, multiple access protocols must meet simplicity and scalability requirements. Access to the channel must be done with reduction of the number of control messages and without resorting to centralization entities. To meet this need, several innovative techniques have been proposed such as: TS-OOK, ASRH-TSOOK, Smart-MAC, Wise-MAC etc. These works propose channel sharing policies allowing nodes to define the parameters of communication: when to start broadcasting? on which logical channel? etc.

However, in view of the extreme density of the network, the multiple access protocols are not able to meet the need to control multi-hop flows on the network. Indeed, given the density of the network, the message broadcast causes feedback loops of the same message thus saturating the system (broadcast storms). Traffic regulation on the network aims to:
  
\begin{itemize}
\item Manage the circulation of data flows over time: whether in case of interdependent communication events or sequences of traffic flows, traffic load evolution presents peaks that generate the congestion phenomena. The principle of communication by appointments and time division multiple access (TDMA), allows to control and schedule communications over time.
\item Control the circulation of flows in space: dense networks present a multitude of routes for transmit data from one node to another. In terms of routing (layer 3), this implies a greater complexity of choice. The risk of local congestion on the network is therefore high. Moreover, for broadcast actions, the multiplication of possible routes implies more redundancy (multiple receptions of the same message by the same node). The directionality of the antennas makes it possible to better control the impact of the transmitted radio signals (interference) while selecting the nodes receiving the message. 
\item Manage energy consumption: communication by appointment allows nodes to plan the waking moments that correspond to the periods of reception and to the periods of emissions. The energy consumed by communications is reduced because the emission power is channeled in a specific direction at a given moment.
\end{itemize}

The regulation of the traffic amounts to defining a logical topology of the network. From the physical topology where any two nodes can communicate when they are within range of each other, we designate a subset of neighboring nodes which can communicate in a predetermined direction and at predetermined times. From this point of view, the logical topology represents an oriented sub-graph of the physical topology. Robustness of the logical topology firstly refers to the connectivity of the sub-graph. Second, the logical topology must ensure that each node is linked to sufficient number of nodes in the both directions 'from' and 'toward' the node. The later property aims to ensure that the logical topology is sufficiently stable in view of the temporal or permanent unavailability of some nodes.

Traffic control protocols for ad-hoc networks have been proposed in the literature \cite{oslr}. One of the best known is the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) \cite{olsr}. The use of this protocol in the case of an ultra-dense network is complicated. OLSR is based on the exchange of neighbor lists near each node. Lists which in the case of dense networks are heavy to transmit and difficult to store or process. Other protocols aim to define a spanning tree over the network's nodes \cite{stp1,stp2}. The logical topology of the network represents then a tree where the the nodes close to the root concentrate more traffic then nodes near the leafs. Therefore these protocols are adapted when the physical structure of the network involves different types of nodes : simple nodes and super-nodes. In addition, such protocols present only one path to link every two nodes, which makes the logical topology unreliable. Few works from literature deal with traffic regulation in dense homogenous ad-hoc networks. In \cite{dense1}, authors discuss the data transfer between the external world and the nanonetwork in flood-based mode. The objective is then restricted to optimize the percentage of informed nodes by classifying the set of nodes into re-transmitters nodes and passive auditors. The flood-based communication model closes the door to the reliable transmission mode (retransmission demand). In addition, the physical architecture is also constrained to grid of nodes with static known positions. Other works \cite{hakim,zhang} only focus on the study of the impact of nanonetwork density over the system performances.    

We propose in this paper an original procedure for the Layer 2.5 networking protocolthat into account the terahertz band particularities. The idea is to extract a logical topology from the dense homogenous nanonetwork that allows both traffic regulation (i.e. reduce the direct communication links) on the network and maintains the robustness against nodes unavailability. This procedure exploit the available steering techniques to schedule over time and space the data transmission. Unlike the other approaches, our method does not impose any conditions on the physical platform and allows unicast and multicast communication in a reliable mode (bidirectional communications).

\section{Formalization of the traffic regulation problem in nanonetworks}
Let $R$ be a nano wireless network composed of $N$ nodes. Each node in the network has a reconfigurable directional antenna that can be steered dynamically to cover a particular direction. Let $T_ {ch}$ be the time needed to change the configuration of an antenna. Let $G (X, A)$the connected graph describing the physical topology of the network with $X$ the set of nodes ($|X|= N$) and $A$ the communication links between the nodes. $(x, y) \in A $ means that it exists a configuration of the antennas of $ x $ and $ y $ that makes the two nodes communicate directly. 

The traffic control problem consists of calculating a directed sub-graph  $ G '(X, E) $ with $ (x, y) \in E \rightarrow (x, y) \in A $ and where the following conditions are satisfied:

\begin{itemize}
\item $ G '$ is connected: whatever is two nodes in the graph, there is a way to route the data from one node to the other.
\begin{dmath}
 $\forall x,y \in X, \exists \text{ a path from }x \text{ to }y$
\end{dmath}
\item 
$ G '$ is robust: whatever the node, there are enough ways to receive data from the other nodes and enough means for the node to broadcast its own data.
\begin{dmath} 
$\forall x \in X, \exists y_1 ... y_p, (y_i,x) \in E and$
$\forall x \in X, \exists y_1 ... y_s, (x,y_i) \in E$
\end{dmath}
The values $ p $ and $ s $ denote the desired level of robustness represented by the number of predecessors and successors of each node. Choosing a large value of $ p $ and $ s $ allows a higher level of robustness that derives from the reliability level of the nodes. When nodes are prone to a high risk of outages or if the energetic capacity of nodes makes it regularly in charging phase, then a high value of $ p $ and $ s $ is more suitable.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{logicaltopology.png}
\caption{Traffic regulation problem : from physical to logical topology}
\label{logicaltopology}
\end{figure}


To each arc $ (x, y) $ of the graph $ G '$ is associated two indexes (or colors) designating the period of time during which $ x $ and $ y $ can communicate according to a particular setting of their antennas. Each node changes the parameters of its antenna in a cyclic manner and at a regular interval of time $ T_s $ according to the different parameters associated with the corresponding indexes. During the period $ S_1 $, the node uses the parameter $ P_1 $ then during the period $ S_2 $, it uses the parameter $ P_2 $ and so on. At the end of the period $ S_ {NS} $ ($ NS $ is the number of periods in one cycle), the node takes the parameter $ P_1 $ for a new period $ S_1 $ and the cycle restarts (figure \ref{trafficregulation}). The duration of a complete cycle $ T_{c} $ is identical for all the nodes (equation \ref{eqtc}). Certain periods $ S_i $ may correspond to periods of time during which the communication devices are deactivated. Moreover, the cycle of a node can comprise several periods with the same parameter ($ i \ neq j, P_i = P_j $).
\begin{dmath}
T_c=NS \ times T_s
\label{eqtc}
\end{dmath}


For a period $ S_i $, a node $ x $ is either in receive or transmit period but not both. If the period $ S_i $ of $ x $ is a reception period, then there exists a single node $ y \ in X $ such that $ (y, x) \ in E $, i.e. only one node listened at a time. If, on the other hand, the period $ S_i $ is a transmission period of $ x $, then there exists at least one node $ y $ such that $ (x, y) \ in E $.

Given the asynchronous nature of the network, the periods $ S_i $ are specific to each node. The figure \ ref {trafficregulation} shows an example of traffic regulation involving 5 nodes. The node (A) has two active periods $S_1$ in transmission and $S_2$ in reception. The period $ S_1 = [0.3-0.4] $ covers 1/10 of $ T_ {c} $ between instants $ 0.3 \ times T_ {c} $ and $ 0.4 \ times T_ {c} $. During this period, the node (A) covers the node (C) which is listening during its period $ S_3 = [0-0.1] $ as well as the node (E) which listens during its period $ S_1 = [0.7 -0.8] $. 

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Exemple of TDMA synchronization}
\label{trafficregulation}
\end{figure}


When two arrows $ (x, y1) $ and $ (x, y2) $ with the same tail have the same index on $ x $, the two incoming nodes $ y1 $ and $ y2 $ are then served by the same multicast stream. By the way, the arrows $ (x1, y) $ and $ (x2, y) $ with the same head can not have the same period index on $ y $ in order to avoid interferences. For any arrow $ (x, y) $, the associated listening period on $ y $ must necessarily be shorter or equal to the associated issue time on $ x $ in order to maximize the sleep periods or to make $ y $ available for another link.

In addition to the respect of traffic regulation constraints, in particular the connectivity and the robustness of the sub-graph G', the traffic control algorithm must take care to maximize the useful listening and transmission times, $ T_i $, ($ T_i \ subset S_i $) as well as the sleep periods of the nodes. A transmission period of a node $ x $ is said to be useful when throughout all its duration, there is always at least one listening node $ y, (x, y) \ in E $. A listening period of a node $ y $ is said to be useful when throughout its duration, the listened node (there is only one) is in transmission phase to $ y $.

\section{Distributed algorithm of traffic regulation}

The design of the traffic control algorithm (algorithm \ref{algo1}) must satisfy two main constraints: a reduced computation requirement and a limited message exchange level. When a node wants to join the nanonetwork, it alternately turns into two modes. In the first mode, the node listens to the channel in the different directions in search of source nodes. In the second mode, the node launches invitations in different directions looking for successor nodes. In successor search mode, the node splits the duration $ T_ {c} $ into $ NS $ equal intervals of duration $ T_ {slot} $. The value of $ NS $ depends on various factors such as the reconfiguration delay $ T_ {steer} $, the cycle duration and the number of needed sources and successors. At the beginning of each interval, the node sets its antenna in a given direction and then launches an invitation. After each reception of an invitation acceptance, the source node updates its useful transmission period . Nodes in source search mode, listen for any invitations. Based on the strength of the received signal and the remaining listening time, the node chooses to accept the invitation or not. In case of acceptance the node registers the useful listening period. Once the number of necessary source nodes is reached (parameter $ p $), the node stops using the source search mode.

To avoid the slow start of the system when only few nodes are already active, the number of listening and annoucement cycles is limited to $ M $. After every $ M $ ordinary operating cycles, a node with not enough sources (resp. successors) listens (resp. re-sends invitations) during an entire cycle (algorithms \ref{algo2}, \ref{algo3}). These two procedures allow nodes that started very early or late compared to other nodes to complete their lists of prefixed links. Therefore, the traffic regulation algorithm does not require synchronization between the nodes of the system.

The disconnection of the graph G '(X, E) is avoided thanks to a long-term procedure which provides that each node, at a very important time interval, listens in all directions whether neighboring nodes belong to other connected components. For this purpose, the nodes of the same connected component share an identifier of the component which corresponds to the smallest MAC identifier of the nodes belonging to the component. When a node detects at another node with a component identifier different from its own, a connection procedure of the two nodes is started.

\section{Tests and results}

To study the contribution of the traffic regulation algorithm in dense nanonetworks, we have established several test scenarios which are distinguished by the number of nodes, the geographical dimension of the network, the range of the radio signal and the density of the network. We first begin by evaluating the impact of traffic regulation on network performance in terms of interference. A first indicator of the impact on interference is the comparison of the number of edges in the graph G(X, A) and the number of arrows in the graph G'(X, E). When $ | E | << | A | $, the average number of signals arriving on each node is reduced considerably. Interference reduction also benefits from time division access mode, directionality of communications and selectivity of sources being listened to. All these factors make it possible to reduce the risks of massive arrival of communications at the same time on the same node.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{nanonet.pdf}
\caption{Traffic regulation for 3 scenarios: 200 nodes, 500 nodes and 1000 nodes}
\label{nanonet}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{nanonet} presents three scenarios differing by the number of nodes evolving in a 2D space of identical dimension. The three scenarios therefore designate three different densities of 200, 500 and 1000 nodes. For each scenario, we give on the left the graph G(X, A) designating the omnidirectional coverage relationships and on the right the graph G'(X, E) obtained by the traffic control algorithm. The traffic regulation is carried out with the maximum number of sources equal to $p=4$ and the maximum number of successors equal to $s=10$. For Scenario 1, the traffic regulation reduces the density of the graph from 1202 edges to 744 arrows, i.e. a reduction of 38\%. For the densest scenario 3, traffic control shifts the graph from 30891 edges to 3997 arrows, which corresponds to a reduction of 87\%.

We also assessed the impact of traffic regulation on network data broadcasting. To this end we have selected three evaluation criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\item The total number of message receptions including redundancies, 
\item Maximum number of receptions of the same message on a one node, 
\item Time for total broadcasting of the message 
\end{itemize} 

The traffic regulation allows, according to the two first criteria, to improve the behavior of the network when a node broadcast a message over the network. Regarding the total number of messages received by the nodes, an approach without traffic regulation will generate for the scenarios 1, 2 and 3 respectively 2404, 15082 and 61618 messages. The number of receptions with traffic control decreases to 744, 1997 and 3997 messages respectively. The maximum number of reception of the same messages varies in the approach without traffic regulation between 24, 45 and 96 for the three scenarios. With Traffic Control, the maximum number of receptions for the same message remains 4 for all three scenarios. This corresponds to the value of the parameter `` maximum number of sources ''. By this means, traffic regulation contributes to the robustness of the network by reducing the effects of non-homogeneous spatial density. The nodes belonging to the dense areas of the network are subjected to the same traffic load as the nodes present in less dense zones.


The number of hops that allows all nodes to receive the message is also a determining factor in the performance of traffic control. It is obvious that the approach without traffic regulation that keeps all the physical links of communications is theoretically quicker  to reach all the nodes. However, the traffic overload induced by the initial physical topology may cause a saturation of the radio medium resulting in interference, queued transmissions and retransmissions. The tests carried out show that the total diffusion of a message depends on the position of the source node in the network. We studied 4 source nodes for Scenario 1 shown in the figure \ref{broadcast}. Broadcasting without traffic regulation from node (A) requires 9 hops while 14 hops are required with traffic control. Similarly, the application of traffic control requires respectively 26, 18 and 22 hops to broadcast a message from the nodes (B), (c) and (D) instead of 12, 12 and 9 jumps without regulation traffic. Overall, for scenario 1 (the least dense), the number of hops for the total broadcast doubles with traffic regulation, a negligible additional cost in return for reducing the total number of exchanged messages.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we proposed a distributed protocol for optimizing the logical topology of an ultra-dense nanonetwork. The objective of this optimization is to reduce the amount of interferences due to the concentration of numerous nodes transmitting in all directions at random instants. The provided logical topology fixes for each node the moments during which it can send data in a given direction to a given selected destination nodes. Each node ignores messages sent by nodes that do not belong to the predefined subset of neighbors. Therefore the energy consumption is optimized since the node transmits and receives only at a given periods each time in a restricted direction and only subset of received communications are forwarded to upper network layers. 
  
The logical topology conception takes into account the connectivity and the robustness of the network, which prevents from the disconnection risks. Hence the reduction of communication direct links between nodes does not impact on data broadcasting coverage. Experimental tests made show that the diminution of the broadcasting speed is limited compared to the gain in terms of transmission redundancy and generated interferences.

Finally the traffic control protocol is adapted to the DAMC protocol used for terahertz communication. On the one hand, the protocol makes that the successors of a given node in a specific direction are in the same range of distance from the transmitter. Therefore all the nodes covered in the same direction are served by the same frequency channel. On the other hand, the distance between nodes and their successors varies according to the transmission direction leading to a better use of the terahertz band.
